⚙️ Yantrix – Terminal-Based ALU Simulator in C++

**Yantrix** is a terminal-based **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) Simulator** written in C++. Designed for systems enthusiasts and students, this simulator emulates low-level arithmetic and logical operations, helping you understand how processors perform computations at the core level.

> 💡 Name Origin: **Yantrix** comes from the Sanskrit word *Yantra* (machine), fused with a modern suffix to reflect a fusion of tradition and technology.
